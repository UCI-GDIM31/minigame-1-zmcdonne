## Devlog
In class, we described Components as the “building blocks” of GameObjects, and GameObjects as the “building blocks” of Scenes. Here I try to visulize this concept using food:) Components are like the ingredients, individual elements that define specific behaviors or characteristics. They’re objects you can assign MonoBehaviours to, and they can be attached to GameObjects.  GameObjects are like the dishes you create from those ingredients. They’re the objects you can see and click on in the Hierarchy window. Each GameObject is made up of multiple Components, and together they define how it looks and behaves within a hierarchical parent–child relationship. Scenes are like full-course meals! Being complete collections that bring all the dishes together into a single experience. A Scene is a Unity file that stores a group of GameObjects loaded into memory at the same time.
